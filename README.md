# Events demo

To trigger some discussion with colleagues.

To run locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:Timendus/events-demo.git
cd events-demo
npm install
npm run serve
```

Single application should then run on http://localhost:3000/ with a fancy four-in-one view at http://localhost:3000/demo.html.
